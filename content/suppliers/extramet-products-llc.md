## Quick Facts

**Headquarters:** United States

**Established:** 1980

**Business Type:** Manufacturer

**Factory:** 10,000+ sq. ft.

## 📦 Products

**Pre-ground Blanks:** Step Blanks, Formed Blanks, Cut-to-Length Rods.

**Wear Parts:** Valve Stems/Seats, Nozzles, Shafts, Bearings.

**Industry Specials:** Medical Micro-shafts, Aerospace Substrates.

## 📌 Why Choose EXTRAMET?

**Best For:** Precision Tool Makers (End Mill/Drill manufacturers) looking to outsource the "roughing" stage to reduce internal cycle times.

### The Technical Advantage (Hard Power)

* **Advanced Blank Preparation:** Extramet's core value lies in delivering materials that are already **near-net-shape**. By supplying precision-ground **Step Blanks** and **Formed Blanks** that match your final tool geometry, they allow tool makers to skip the time-consuming "rough grinding" process. This directly solves the bottleneck of machine capacity and eliminates the costly headache of handling excess carbide sludge/scrap in your own shop.
* **Extreme Grinding Precision:** Leveraging their specific expertise in Centerless and **CNC Cylindrical Grinding**, they achieve concentricity tolerances as tight as **0.0002 inches**. For buyers in the medical and aerospace sectors, this guarantees that the substrate is perfectly balanced for high-speed rotation tools, reducing vibration and ensuring superior surface finishes on the final workpiece.

### The Operational Advantage (Soft Power)

* **Swiss Precision, American Scale:** Headquartered in Latrobe, PA (the heart of the US carbide industry) but **founded in Switzerland**, Extramet uniquely combines Swiss dimensional rigor with American high-volume manufacturing capacity. Their heavy investment in automated CNC loading systems allows them to handle the entire spectrum of orders, from single **R&D prototypes** to massive industrial production runs.
