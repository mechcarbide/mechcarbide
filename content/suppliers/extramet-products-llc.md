## Editor's Review

While many suppliers just sell raw rods, Extramet sells **efficiency**. Their core philosophy revolves around 'Blank Preparation', taking raw carbide and grinding it into precision **Step Blanks** or **Formed Blanks** before it even reaches your factory.

### Why this matters to you:

* **Cut Your Cycle Time:** By purchasing pre-ground step blanks from Extramet, tool makers can skip the time-consuming rough grinding process and go straight to CNC finishing. This significantly reduces your machine cycle time and scrap rates.
* **Swiss DNA, American Muscle:** Founded in Switzerland in 1980 and expanded to a massive facility in Latrobe, PA, Extramet combines Swiss dimensional precision with American high-volume production capacity.
* **Aerospace Focus:** They are one of the few suppliers who truly understand the carbide substrate requirements for machining modern aerospace composites (CFRP/Titanium). If you make aerospace tools, their specialized grades are a must-have.

## Company Profile

### From Swiss Roots to Global Precision

Extramet AG was founded in 1980 in Central Switzerland as a specialized three-man manufacturing unit. In 1996, the company expanded its vision by establishing Micron Industries in the USA, which later rebranded as **Extramet Products**. Today, headquartered in **Latrobe, Pennsylvania**—the historic heart of the American carbide industry—Extramet has evolved into a premier supplier of ground carbide materials.

### Continuous Investment in Capacity

Extramet's history is defined by constant reinvestment in technology to reduce customer lead times. Notable milestones include a **10,000 sq. ft. expansion in 2016** to house advanced CNC capacity and a major **automation upgrade in 2021**. These investments allow them to handle everything from single prototype items to massive regular releases for the aerospace, medical, and energy sectors. They operate under strict **ISO 9001:2015** standards, ensuring quality reliability.
