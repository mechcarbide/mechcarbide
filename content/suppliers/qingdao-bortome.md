  structured_description: "Qingdao Bortome Import & Export Co., Ltd. is a
    wholly-owned subsidiary of the public listed company Tongyu Heavy Industry
    (Stock Code: 300185), located in Qingdao, China. Initiating tungsten carbide
    production in 1972, the company has over 40 years of experience and ranks
    among China's top 10 carbide manufacturers. They operate advanced facilities
    featuring German PVA sintering furnaces and dust-free pressing workshops.
    Their core product range includes tungsten carbide rods (annual capacity up
    to 1,100 tons), strips, and precision wear parts. A key technical
    differentiator is their \"Gradient Alloy\" technology for mining buttons,
    developed with American experts to extend tool life by 30-50%. Additionally,
    they are a specialized supplier of Stellite (cobalt-based) and nickel-based
    alloys for high-temperature aerospace and energy applications."

## 📌 Why Choose Qingdao Bortome?

**Best For:** Large-scale distributors and heavy industry buyers (Mining/Oil & Gas) seeking a financially stable partner capable of high-volume, consistent production.

* **Backed by Public Listed Stability:** Security is a major concern when selecting an overseas OEM partner. Qingdao Bortome is a wholly-owned subsidiary of **Tongyu Heavy Industry (Stock Code: 300185)**. This corporate backing ensures robust financial health, minimized supply chain risks, and long-term operational stability. Compared to smaller, independent workshops, Bortome is a safer choice for large, recurring contracts.
* **Advanced "Gradient Alloy" for Mining:** For buyers in the **drilling and mining** sectors, durability is currency. Collaborating with **American experts**, Bortome has developed a proprietary **Gradient Alloy** technology. This innovation significantly enhances the wear resistance of their carbide buttons, extending service life by approximately **30%-50%**. This directly translates to reduced downtime and lower operational costs for end-users in rock drilling applications.
* **German-Standard Sintering Consistency:** To compete with top-tier global brands, they have invested heavily in infrastructure, utilizing imported **German PVA sintering furnaces** and a dust-free pressing workshop (capable of **1g to 50kg** pressing). This setup ensures metallurgical purity and structural uniformity. Their internal data suggests product performance and lifespan reach **90-97%** of leading international brands, offering an excellent price-performance ratio.
* **Precision Finishing & Stellite Capabilities:** Beyond standard carbide, they possess a distinct advantage in advanced materials and finishing. With **192 sets of machining equipment**, they deliver ground rods to h5/h6 tolerance and mirror-finish parts with **0.01µm roughness**. Uniquely, they also supply **Stellite alloys** for extreme heat and corrosion environments (**Aerospace, Nuclear**), a capability that separates them from general carbide producers.
