## 📌 Why Choose Fuji Die?

**Best For:** EV Motor Core Manufacturers, Electronic Connector Stampers, and Wire/Tube Drawing Mills demanding extreme mold longevity and surface finish.

### The Technical Advantage (Hard Power)

* **EV Motor Core Specialization:** High-speed stamping of thin electrical steel sheets often causes standard carbide edges to chip due to "particle dropout." Fuji Die developed **specific grades like VG48** with an optimized binder-structure balance. For **EV motor manufacturers**, this technology prevents premature edge failure, ensuring molds last for millions of strokes while maintaining burr-free precision.
* **Nano-Grain Technology:** For the semiconductor and micro-electronics industries, standard micro-grain carbide isn't sharp enough. Fuji Die's **FS06** utilizes ultra-fine **nanoparticles** to achieve extreme flexural strength and razor-sharp edge retention. This allows for the production of slitting knives and connector molds that deliver flawless cuts on microscopic components.

### The Operational Advantage (Soft Power)

* **Prime Market Stability:** As a company listed on the **Tokyo Stock Exchange** (Prime Market), Fuji Die offers a level of corporate governance and financial stability that smaller family-run mold shops cannot provide. This makes them a "zero-risk" long-term partner for global automotive and battery giants who require a secure supply chain capable of scaling with their multi-decade production plans.
