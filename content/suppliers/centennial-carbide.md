## 📌Why Choose Centennial Carbide?

**Best For:** Precision Tool Makers and Job Shops requiring high-mix, quick-turnaround carbide blanks.

* **Targeted Inventory Strategy:** Centennial specializes deeply in specific form factors rather than trying to be a generalist. Thanks to their adequate inventory of **rod blanks** (standard and micrograin) and **strips**, they solve the availability bottleneck for tool manufacturers who need immediate stock for end-mill or wear part production. Their inventory includes pre-ground **h6 tolerance** carbide rods, reducing the preparation time for your grinding operations.
* **Flexible Sourcing & Grade Variety:** Unlike manufacturers limited to their own proprietary blends, Centennial sources material from **multiple manufacturers**. This allows them to offer a selection of proven **grades**, from general-purpose C-2 (92.1 Ra) to Ultra-Micrograin (92.5 Ra). This flexibility ensures you get the specific hardness and transverse rupture strength (TRS) required for your specific cutting or wear application without being locked into a single source's limitations.
* **"Specials" and Customization Services:** For projects where standard catalog sizes do not fit, Centennial provides **custom solid carbide products** per user specifications. Their "Standards and Specials" approach means they can handle complex preforms or specific coolant hole configurations. This capability is critical for engineers developing non-standard tools who need a partner willing to consult on and supply low-volume custom blanks.
* **Integrated Scrap Recycling Program:** Centennial Carbide offers a closed-loop value service by **purchasing tungsten carbide scrap**. For high-volume users of carbide blanks, this simplifies logistics and cost recovery. You can source new blanks and sell used tooling or scraps through a single partner, streamlining your supply chain management.
