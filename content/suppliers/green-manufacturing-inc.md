Greenteeth®, a brand under Green Manufacturing, Inc., originated in the 1990s when arborist Kevin Green sought **a more efficient way to replace stump grinder teeth in the field**. This led to the development of **a turnable, carbide-tipped tooth system** that eliminated the need to remove pockets during replacement. The positive performance of the early prototypes prompted the establishment of Green Manufacturing to produce Greenteeth for tree-care professionals globally. 

Today, the company continues to focus on innovation, using advanced CNC machining and environmentally conscious processes. **All products are manufactured in the United States** and designed to improve durability and operational efficiency.
