## 📌Why Choose Hartmetall UK?

**Best For:** UK and European cutting tool manufacturers (grinding shops) looking to outsource "roughing" operations to increase their own production capacity.

* **The "Capacity Multiplier" Service:** Hartmetall UK goes beyond simple distribution by acting as an extension of your production floor. Their "**Blank Preparation**" service handles pre-grinding operations, such as **cutting**, **chamfering**, tapers, and ball nose preparation. By outsourcing these time-consuming setup tasks to them, you reduce cycle times on your own CNC machines, effectively increasing your parts-per-shift output without the need to purchase new equipment.
* **Premium Sourcing Strategy:** As an independent distributor, Hartmetall UK sources from world-leading manufacturers, most notably **Extramet**. This partnership ensures that customers receive premium-grade carbide (often **Swiss-quality**) known for consistency and performance, combined with the agility and local support of a UK-based supplier.
* **Precision Metrology & Quality Control:** To ensure "right first time" accuracy for bespoke blanks, they utilize high-end equipment from **Mitutoyo**, **Schneider**, and **Taylor Hobson**. This rigorous inspection capability guarantees that the preforms you receive meet tight tolerances, allowing your team to move immediately to the final finishing stages without quality concerns.
* **CNC Wheel Dressing Service:** They offer a specialized **CNC wheel dressing service** that achieves runout as low as **0.002mm**. Since high-quality diamond grinding wheels are a significant expense for tool makers, this service helps maintain optimum wheel performance and prolongs service life, directly reducing your consumable costs.
* **Agile Logistics & Stock Replenishment:** With a comprehensive stock held in the UK that is **replenished weekly**, they offer short delivery times (often **next-day**). This reliability allows tool manufacturers to operate with leaner inventories, confident that standard solid or coolant-hole rods can be delivered immediately when urgent orders arise.
