## Editor's Review

SLB (formerly Schlumberger) is not just a supplier; they are the **operating system of the global oil & gas industry**. While their recent rebranding emphasizes digital and new energy, their legacy in hard rock drilling remains unmatched through their **Smith Bits** heritage.

### Why SLB defines the industry:

* **Material Science at the Edge:** SLB doesn't just buy carbide; they engineer it. Their drill bits utilize proprietary PDC and tungsten carbide grades designed to survive the harshest environments on Earth (high heat, extreme abrasion, and shock).
* **The Smith Bits Legacy:** By integrating Smith Bits, SLB offers the world's most advanced portfolio of Roller Cone and PDC bits. If you are drilling through the toughest granite or abrasive sandstone, their bit technology is the gold standard.
* **Global Scale:** With hubs in **100+ countries** and R&D centers that rival top universities, SLB offers a level of field support and technical availability that no standalone carbide manufacturer can touch.

## Product Range

### Drill Bits (Smith Bits)

* PDC Bits
* Roller Cone Bits
* Stinger™ Elements

### Downhole Drilling Tools

* Rotary Steerable Systems (RSS)
* Reamers & Hole Openers
* Mud Motors

### Cutting Elements (Components)

* Diamond (PDC) Cutters
* Carbide Inserts

## Company Profile

### A Century of Pushing Limits

The story began in France in the 1920s when brothers Conrad and Marcel Schlumberger invented wireline logging, forever changing how we map the subsurface. Over the next 100 years, the company evolved from a logging pioneer into a global technology powerhouse.

### Strategic Evolution

A pivotal moment for hard material technology was the acquisition of **Smith International** in 2010, which brought world-class drill bit manufacturing (Smith Bits) under the Schlumberger umbrella. In October 2022, the company rebranded as SLB, signaling a strategic shift towards decarbonizing the energy industry while continuing to innovate in oil and gas efficiency. Today, **SLB** operates in over 100 countries with a workforce representing 160 nationalities.

## Capabilities

### Advanced Drill Bit Engineering (Smith Bits)

* **Proprietary Cutting Structures:** SLB engineers specific carbide shapes and PDC cutter layouts (like the Stinger™ conical diamond element) to maximize Rate of Penetration (ROP).
* **IDEAS™ Simulation:** They don't guess; they simulate. Their integrated drillbit design platform tests how specific carbide grades will interact with specific rock formations before a physical bit is ever made.

### Extreme Environment Solutions

* **HPHT Mastery:** SLB tools are designed for High-Pressure High-Temperature wells, requiring carbide and diamond components that maintain integrity where standard materials fail.
* **Rotary Steerable Systems (RSS):** Their **PowerDrive** systems utilize complex, ruggedized carbide components to steer drill bits miles underground with pinpoint accuracy.

### Global Manufacturing & Service

* With over **900 facilities** globally, SLB has the capability to manufacture, repair, and service drilling tools locally, ensuring that the right hard material solution is always within reach of the rig site.
