## Editor's Review

Kennametal is the definitive American powerhouse in the carbide industry. Unlike competitors who focus solely on geometry, Kennametal's DNA is rooted in **metallurgy**. Founded by Philip McKenna, the inventor of **Tungsten-Titanium Carbide**, they continue to lead the world in developing new substrates that redefine hardness and toughness.

### Why Kennametal is a strategic partner:

* **The 'Double Threat':** They are one of the few companies globally that dominate both precision metal cutting (aerospace/auto) AND heavy infrastructure (mining/road milling). If you need to cut metal or cut the earth, they have a solution.
* **Cost Per Part (CPP) Guarantee:** This is their killer service. Kennametal is so confident in their tools that they offer an on-site management program that guarantees specific savings in your shop. They don't just sell tools; they sell profitability.
* **Advanced Materials & AM:** Beyond standard carbide, they own legendary brands like Stellite™ (wear-resistant alloys). They have successfully adapted these proprietary materials for 3D Printing (Additive Manufacturing), offering **Stellite™**, **Nistelle™**, and **Delcrome™** additive powders to produce complex, wear-resistant components that traditional methods cannot match.
