## 📌Why Choose AFC Hartmetall?

**Best For:** Precision tool manufacturers (especially drill and reamer makers) requiring complex coolant architectures and deep-hole drilling solutions.

* **Unmatched Coolant Channel Architecture:** While many suppliers offer standard 2-hole rods, AFC Hartmetall's patented processes allow for rods with **up to 16 coolant channels**, as well as complex **kidney or lenticular shapes**. For tool makers, this flexibility solves critical heat evacuation and chip removal issues in deep-hole drilling applications, allowing you to manufacture high-performance tools that outlast the competition.
* **"Green" Preforming for Production Efficiency:** AFC Hartmetall offers customer-specific **"green machined" preforms**. By ordering blanks that are already shaped, cut to length, or pre-drilled with lateral exit holes while the carbide is still in its **soft state**, you significantly reduce the need for hard grinding and finishing at your facility. This translates to **lower diamond wheel costs**, reduced machining time, and faster turnaround for your final tools.
* **Extreme Customization Capability:** Their manufacturing competence covers a vast range of **non-standard specifications**. Whether you need a variable **helix (0 - 65°)**, reduced pitch tolerances for micro-drills, or lateral exit holes in specific forward/backward orientations, AFC Hartmetall can deliver. This level of customization is vital for engineers designing specialized tools where off-the-shelf blanks simply won't work.
* **Global Scale with German Precision:** As part of the **[Hyperion Materials & Technologies](https://www.mechcarbide.com/suppliers/hyperion-materials-technologies/)** family, AFC Hartmetall combines the agility and technical depth of a specialized German manufacturer with the **financial stability** and **R&D power** of a global materials giant. This partnership ensures supply chain security and continuous material innovation. As a customer, your supply source is both technologically advanced and commercially stable.
