## 📌 Why Choose Freud Tools?

**Best For:** Industrial window/door manufacturers and professional woodworkers seeking custom-formulated carbide tools for extended lifespan and precision.

* **In-House Carbide Formulation:** Freud produces its own carbide in-house in Italy. Their proprietary **TiCo™ (Titanium Cobalt) Carbide** is a high-density formulation that allows them to adjust the grade specifically for each application, whether it's ripping hardwood or cutting laminate. For the user, this means a sharper cutting edge that retains its geometry significantly longer than generic carbide, maximizing the return on every tool investment.
* **Advanced Anti-Vibration & Coating Tech:** Freud tools are engineered for silence and stability. Their laser-cut **anti-vibration slots** are filled with **thermal-plastic polyurethane**, which absorbs noise and prevents blade wobble. Combined with their innovative coatings like **Silver I.C.E.** and **Perma-SHIELD**, the blades effectively resist heat build-up, corrosion, and resin accumulation. This results in cooler cuts, less motor strain, and reduced downtime for cleaning.
* **Revolutionary Window Tooling:** For window and door fabrication, Freud offers the exclusive **High Speed ISOprofil (H.S.I.) technology**. This system enables manufacturers to achieve remarkable **productivity gains** and **superior surface finishes**. As an **IFT Rosenheim certified "System House,"** Freud goes beyond selling cutters. They provide a complete ecosystem, including **"Cascading" services** for CE certification support, documentation management via "quasarfreud" software, and technical training.
* **Bosch Group Global Network:** Since joining the **Bosch Group** in 2009, Freud has leveraged a massive global network for **distribution** and **R&D**. While maintaining their heritage of **Italian craftsmanship**, this partnership ensures that customers anywhere in the world have access to reliable supply chains, cutting-edge innovation, and robust technical support. So, for the buyer, Freud is a secure partner for large-scale industrial operations.
