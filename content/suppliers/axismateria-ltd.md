## 📌Why Choose AXISMATERIA?

**Best For:** Manufacturers of micro-precision tools (PCB drills, electronics) and high-end tool makers demanding absolute Japanese material consistency.

* **Sumitomo Group Vertical Integration:** As a subsidiary of Sumitomo Electric Hardmetal, AXISMATERIA benefits from **a fully integrated supply chain**. The group manages the entire process from raw tungsten refining to carbonizing and sintering. For the buyer, this guarantees **a stable supply of raw materials**, even during global shortages, and ensures that the chemical composition of the carbide remains identical from batch to batch, year after year.
* **World-Leading Micro-Drill Technology:** Holding a top global market share in **blanks for PCB drills**, AXISMATERIA specializes in "super small diameter" rods. Their manufacturing process focuses on the thorough elimination of foreign substances and internal defects. This level of purity is critical for micro-tools, where even microscopic inclusions can cause immediate breakage. This expertise translates into superior runout control and transverse rupture strength for all their small-diameter products.
* **Advanced R&D via PMIC:** Customers gain access to cutting-edge metallurgy through the company's close cooperation with the **Powder Metallurgy Innovation Center (PMIC)** of Sumitomo Electric. This allows AXISMATERIA to rapidly deploy the latest grade technologies, developed by one of the world's most advanced material science labs, into standard commercial rods and custom die/mold blanks, giving tool makers a competitive edge in performance.
* **Strict Japanese Quality Control:** Originating from the renowned "**IGETALLOY™**" lineage (since 1931), the company employs rigorous Japanese quality management systems. Their focus extends beyond simple hardness testing to ensuring the elimination of impurities that affect tool life. This makes them a reliable partner for industries like automotive and aerospace.
