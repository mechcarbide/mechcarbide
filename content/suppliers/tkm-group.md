## Capabilities

### Ultra-Precision Manufacturing

TKM redefines what "precision" means in industrial knives:

* **Thickness Tolerance:** Guaranteed to **±0.0005 mm**. To minimize cumulative errors on the shaft, they classify tools into three sub-micron tolerance zones (-, 0, +).
* **Surface Finish:** Ground to mirror polish with Roughness (Ra) **≤ 0.03 μm** and Gloss levels **\> 1000 GU**, ensuring minimal friction and cleanest cuts.
* **Drilling Accuracy:** Up to H3 precision, ensuring perfect fitment on the arbor.

### Digital Solutions (CASKA 4.0)

* **Smart Setup:** Their in-house developed CASKA software calculates the optimal arbor setup mathematically, reducing setup times and improving knife service life. It interfaces directly with customer ERP systems for seamless operation.

### Advanced Services

* **Subcontracting:** Leveraging their massive machinery park, TKM offers contract manufacturing for large workpieces (up to **8,000 mm length**) including milling, heat treatment, and grinding.
* **Thermal Coating (TTT):** Next-generation coatings that improve durability for valves, rolls, and impellers, protecting them against extreme wear and corrosion.
* Recycling: A closed-loop system for Log Saw Blades, turning old D2 steel back into new raw material, saving energy and resources.
