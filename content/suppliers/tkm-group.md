## 📌 Why Choose TKM Group?

**Best For:** Lithium-Ion Battery Manufacturers (requiring burr-free electrode slitting), Metal Service Centers, and High-Speed Paper/Film Converters.

* **Sub-Micron Precision:** TKM defines the industry standard for slitting accuracy, holding thickness tolerances as tight as **±0.0005 mm**. Unlike standard grinding, they classify tools into specific tolerance zones (-, 0, +) to neutralize cumulative errors on the shaft. For Lithium Battery and Thin-Film producers, this extreme precision is critical as it guarantees a constant cutting gap, preventing microscopic burrs that could cause short circuits or quality defects.
* **Surface Finish Mastery:** Their specialized polishing technology achieves **Mirror Finishes (Ra ≤ 0.03 μm)**. This ultra-smooth surface significantly reduces friction and dust generation during high-speed cutting, preventing material sticking and extending the operational life of the blade.
* **Algorithmic Setup:** Slitting lines often suffer from downtime due to manual setup errors. TKM solves this with their proprietary **CASKA 4.0** software, which mathematically calculates the optimal arbor setup based on the specific job. This digital assistant eliminates human guesswork, drastically reducing machine setup time and ensuring the correct cutting gap is achieved on the first try.
* **Global Group Stability:** As a member of the prestigious **Groz-Beckert Group**, TKM offers the financial stability and global reach of a Tier-1 industrial partner. This ensures long-term supply security and access to a worldwide service network for regrinding and technical support, no matter where your factory is located.
