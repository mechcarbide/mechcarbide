### Strategic Manufacturing Footprint

Basic Carbide operates four specialized facilities across Pennsylvania, totaling **over 117,000 square feet** of manufacturing space:

* **Lowber, PA (HQ & Nickel Division):** The heart of their corrosion-resistant carbide production.
* **Buena Vista, PA (Cobalt Division):** Dedicated to large-scale cobalt binder preforms.
* **Sutersville, PA (Press Plant):** High-volume automatic pressing center for cost-effective mass production.
* **Latrobe, PA (Finishing Plant):** A massive engineering hub for grinding and final machining.

This strategic division of labor allows Basic Carbide to optimize efficiency for each product type, offering **quick turnarounds** for both "off-the-shelf" standard rings and custom-engineered components.

## Capabilities

### Production

**Specialized Material Production**

* **Nickel Binder Expertise:** Operating the industry's only known facility dedicated solely to Nickel carbides, capable of producing seal rings up to 20 inches in diameter.
* **Cobalt & Large Preforms:** The Buena Vista facility specializes in Cobalt binder grades, handling some of the largest preforms available in the global market.
