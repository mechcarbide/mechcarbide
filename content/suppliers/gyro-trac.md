## NEXUS® Service Platform

Gyro-Trac's NEXUS® Service Platform is an advanced **customer support system** designed to keep forestry mulchers running at peak performance. **Available 24/7, NEXUS® connects users directly with highly trained Gyro-Trac specialists who can diagnose and resolve issues remotely.** This eliminates costly downtime and the need to transport equipment for repairs, allowing operators to get back to work quickly and efficiently while maximizing productivity in the field.

## SABRE-TOOTH TITAN Cutting Technology

Gyro-Trac's SABRE-TOOTH TITAN represents the next generation of innovative **cutting technology**, engineered to pulverize wood into fine, sawdust-like mulch. This upgraded design features **a wider tooth secured by a wedged friction block**, removing stress from the single mounting bolt for faster, easier replacement. **Dual control ribs** ensure a more stable, controlled bite, while the **KNOCK-OUT RELIEF with a SPLIT BLOCK** reduces resistance, splits wood chips efficiently, and creates a self-cleaning effect. The result is smoother operation, reduced wear, and maximum productivity in demanding mulching applications.
