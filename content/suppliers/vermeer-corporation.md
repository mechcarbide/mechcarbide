## Vermeer Damage Defense System

The Vermeer Damage Defense system is designed to enhance safety and protect equipment during **tub and horizontal grinder** operations. It helps operators manage situations where **metal contaminants** may be mixed with incoming materials. When the grinder's mill detects contact with metal, the system **sends an alert** to the control panel and automatically begins shutting down the machine. At the same time, it **reverses the feed system** to reduce the chance of metal entering the mill.
