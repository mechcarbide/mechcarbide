## 📌 Why Choose Carbide Technologies Inc (CTI)?

**Best For:** Tool makers serving the Aerospace and Automotive industries who require documented metallurgical consistency and traceability.

* **Trusted by Industry Giants:** CTI stands out for meeting the rigorous standards of the world's most demanding end-users. Their materials have won approval from industry titans such as **Boeing**, **Pratt Whitney**, **Northrop**, and **General Electric**. For buyers, this serves as the ultimate quality validation. If their carbide blanks & preforms meet the fatigue and stress requirements of jet engines, they are more than capable of handling general industrial applications.
* **From Powder Blending to Sinter-HIP:** CTI operates its **own powder manufacturing facility**. They blend powders in **controlled 300kg lots**, ensuring batch-to-batch uniformity that "ready-to-press" buyers often struggle to achieve. Furthermore, their use of **Ultra-Temp Sinter HIP** (Hot Isostatic Pressing) technology minimizes internal porosity, resulting in blanks with superior transverse rupture strength and density.
* **Metallurgical Support:** CTI provides value beyond the product through its fully staffed & equipped **internal laboratory**. They don't just test for shipping; they offer **Tool Failure Analysis** and **material characterization** services to their customers. If your tools are failing prematurely, CTI has the capability (**Microscopy to 1750X**, **LECO Carbon Analysis**) to determine if the issue lies in the grade selection or the application.
* **Traceability and Data Archiving:** For industries requiring strict compliance, CTI is the right choice. They track and store all production metrics and product information in their database for at least **three years**, then transfer this data to optical discs for **permanent storage**. This ensures 100% traceability from the raw powder source to the finished sintered blank.
