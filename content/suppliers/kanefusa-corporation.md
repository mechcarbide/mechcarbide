## Editor's Review

Kanefusa challenges the traditional mindset of the tooling industry. While most manufacturers focus on how many times a blade can be resharpened, Kanefusa argues that **'Single Use' (Disposable)** tools actually offer lower total operating costs for high-volume factories.

### Why Kanefusa is a strategic choice:

* **Predictability is King:** By using their disposable cold saws, automotive and steel plants eliminate the variability of regrinding. Every blade performs exactly like the last one, guaranteeing **100% predictable machine uptime**, a massive benefit for Just-In-Time production lines.
* **Profit from Waste Reduction:** In industries processing expensive materials like aluminum or high-end timber, their **Thin Kerf technology** isn't just a feature; it's a profit multiplier. Improving material yield by even 12% can save millions in raw material costs annually.
* **Japanese Reliability:** From paper mills to plastic factories, Kanefusa is the 'set-it-and-forget-it' option. Their tools are engineered to stay straight and sharp longer, minimizing maintenance interruptions.

## Company Profile

### 120 Years of Japanese Monozukuri

Headquartered in Aichi, Japan, Kanefusa Corporation is a publicly traded company (Tokyo Stock Exchange) with a heritage dating back to 1948 (and **roots over 120 years**). As Japan's leading manufacturer of industrial knives and saw blades, Kanefusa embodies the spirit of **"Monozukuri" (craftsmanship)**. With over 1,300 employees and a consolidated net sales of 20.2 billion Yen, they serve the global market with a philosophy of creating products that are "essential" to industrial infrastructure.

From their dedicated Technical Center to collaborations with universities, Kanefusa consistently pushes the boundaries of cutting technology for wood, metal, paper, and advanced materials.

## Capabilities

### Metal Cutting: The FM & PCD Series

* **FM Cold Saw Technology:** A specialized tooth geometry combined with Cermet/Carbide grades designed for single-use. Delivers **300% longer life** than band saws and superior cut finish.
* **PCD Fusion:** A patented method to fuse micro-PCD tips onto carbide substrates (**Novametal Pro DIA**), enabling cost-effective diamond cutting for high-silicon aluminum.

### Vibration & Kerf Control

* **LS-P Slits (Laser Slits with Polymer):** A unique damping system where polymer is injected into laser-cut slots on the saw body. This absorbs high-frequency vibration, enabling **20% thinner kerfs** without losing stability.

### Surface & Bonding Science

* **Advanced Material Treatment (HS-HP / HC-UP):** A proprietary surface modification for HSS and Carbide that alters wear characteristics, extending edge life by **3-15 times**.
* **VITECH-TC Bonding:** A low-temperature bonding process for paper knives that replaces traditional brazing. It eliminates thermal stress, ensuring exceptional straightness and preventing bowing over long lengths.
