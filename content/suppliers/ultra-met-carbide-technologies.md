## 📌 Why Choose Ultra-Met Carbide Technologies?

**Best For:** Toolmakers and fabricators looking for "near-net-shape" blanks to reduce their own finishing costs, particularly in the Aerospace, Automotive, and Energy sectors.

* **Precision "Green" Machining for Lower Finishing Costs:** Ultra-Met's standout capability is their ability to machine components in the **"green state"** (before final sintering). By delivering preforms that are geometrically closer to your final specifications, they significantly **shorten your production cycle**. This means you spend less time grinding down raw blocks and more time on high-value finishing.
* **End-to-End Control:** Ultra-Met handles the entire process in-house, starting with the formulation of **Ready-To-Press (RTP) powders**. Whether you need Nano-grain grades for aerospace precision or tough grades for mining, they blend specific binders (Cobalt/Nickel) and carbides to meet exact performance metrics. This vertical integration ensures consistent metallurgical quality from batch to batch.
* **Versatile Pressing Capabilities:** Ultra-Met offers a rare flexibility in sizing. With CNC presses ranging **from 16 to 200 tons**, they can handle intricate, high-volume parts with **complex geometries**. Uniquely, they also operate an **ISO Press** capable of manufacturing very large carbide components (over **15 inches long**), making them a reliable problem solver for heavy-duty oil and gas applications that standard molders cannot handle.
* **Independent Agility with In-House Tooling:** As a leading independent American manufacturer, Ultra-Met designs and fabricates **custom dies in-house**. This allows for faster turnaround times on prototypes and custom orders. Their engineering team uses **3D modeling** simulations to design dies that minimize flashing and ensure tight tolerances. Besides, three types of dies (**single cavity, split cavity, and multiple-out**) are employed in their powder metal manufacturing processes.
