## 📌 Why Choose Preform Specialties & Carbide Metals?

**Best For:** Toolmakers requiring a mix of custom-shaped preforms and long extruded rods, specifically those looking for tight-tolerance blanks that reduce their own finishing workload.

* **Custom Molding & Extrusion:** Operating as a unified facility, this supplier combines the strengths of two distinct entities: **Preform Specialties** (custom shapes) and **Carbide Metals** (extrusion). This integration allows them to handle diverse orders under one roof, from complex, pressed-to-shape preforms to extruded coolant rods in lengths up to **37 inches**. The supply chain of customers needing both standard stock and engineered specials is simplified.
* **Precision "Green" Machining:** They excel in machining carbide in its **"green" (pre-sintered) state**. Their skilled team can turn, drill, flute, and bore complex geometries before the material hardens. For the buyer, this means receiving a preform that is significantly closer to the final part shape, minimizing the expensive and time-consuming diamond grinding required at your end.
* **Advanced Sinter-HIP Technology:** To ensure structural integrity, they utilize Sinter-**HIP (Hot Isostatic Pressure) furnaces**. This process combines vacuum sintering with high pressure to effectively minimize or eliminate internal porosity. The result is a denser, tougher carbide product with improved transverse rupture strength, ideal for applications involving extreme wear or heavy loading.
* **In-House Precision Grinding:** Unlike suppliers who only provide rough blanks, PSI/CMI features a fully equipped **on-site grind shop**. Whether you need centerless grinding, surface grinding, or polishing, they can deliver finished tolerances as tight as **.0002"**. This "finish-to-print" capability makes them a reliable partner for high-precision projects where accuracy is important.
