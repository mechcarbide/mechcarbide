## Editor's Review

If Sandvik is the encyclopedia of tooling, ISCAR is the iPhone. As the crown jewel of the **IMC Group (a Berkshire Hathaway company)**, ISCAR is famous for rewriting the rules of machining geometry. They don't just improve existing tools; they invent entirely new categories.

## Company Profile

### From a Backyard Shack to Warren Buffett's Portfolio

ISCAR's story is one of the most legendary in the industrial world. Founded in 1952 by Stef Wertheimer in a small shack in Israel, it has grown into the largest of the 15 companies comprising the **IMC Group**. In 2006, ISCAR's relentless growth and profitability caught the eye of **Berkshire Hathaway**, making it one of Warren Buffett’s most significant international acquisitions.

### Global Powerhouse

Today, headquartered in Tefen, Israel, ISCAR operates in over **60 countries** with more than **130 subsidiaries**. Their massive central manufacturing facility is a fully automated marvel of robotics and AI. ISCAR is not just a manufacturer but an educational institution, hosting technical seminars globally to train customers on the latest 'High IQ' machining strategies.

## Capabilities

### Modular "Change-and-Go" Technology

ISCAR dominates the market with its interchangeable head systems:

* **MULTI-MASTER:** A family of milling tools with threaded carbide heads. Operators can replace a worn head by hand in seconds, ensuring **zero repeatability error** and eliminating machine downtime.
* **CHAMDRILL / SUMOCHAM:** The world's most successful interchangeable tip drilling lines. The unique **self-clamping** design uses cutting forces to tighten the grip—the harder you drill, the tighter it holds.

### LOGIQ & High-Feed Geometries

ISCAR's "LOGIQ" campaign focuses on smarter machining:

* **Tangential Clamping:** Their inserts are often mounted tangentially (sideways) rather than flat. This directs cutting forces into the thickest part of the holder, allowing for **extreme feed rates** that would snap standard tools.
* **JET-CUT Cooling:** Many ISCAR tools feature internal coolant channels that blast high-pressure fluid directly at the cutting edge, breaking chips instantly and extending tool life in heat-resistant superalloys (HRSA).

### Industry 4.0 & Tool Management

* **MATRIX Dispensers:** Smart vending machines that track every single insert usage.
* **Insert Converter:** An intelligent app that cross-references competitors' grades to find the exact ISCAR equivalent, making switching suppliers seamless.
