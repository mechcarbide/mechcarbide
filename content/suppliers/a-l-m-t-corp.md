  structured_description: A.L.M.T. Corp., established in 2000 through the merger
    of Tokyo Tungsten and Osaka Diamond Industrial, is a wholly owned subsidiary
    of Sumitomo Electric Industries based in Tokyo, Japan. With over 80 years of
    heritage dating back to 1939, the company specializes in high-melting-point
    materials (Tungsten, Molybdenum) and precision Diamond/CBN tools. A.L.M.T.
    distinguishes itself with complete vertical integration from powder
    refinement to finished products, and a dedicated Customer Solution Center
    (CSC) that offers advanced 3D analysis, SEM/EDX evaluation, and machining
    simulations. They also produce high-performance heat spreaders for
    electronics and employ proprietary molten salt recycling technology for
    sustainable tungsten recovery.

## 📌 Why Choose A.L.M.T. Corp.?

**Best For:** High-tech manufacturers (Semiconductor, Electronics, Automotive) requiring ultra-high precision materials and comprehensive thermal management solutions.

* **Backed by Sumitomo Electric Group Power:** A.L.M.T. is a powerhouse formed by the merger of **Tokyo Tungsten** and **Osaka Diamond Industrial**, now fully owned by **Sumitomo Electric**. For buyers, this lineage guarantees absolute **stability** and access to top-tier **R&D resources**. They offer complete **vertical integration**, controlling everything from the refinement of high-melting-point metal powders (Tungsten/Molybdenum) to the final production of precision tools.
* **The "Customer Solution Center" (CSC) Advantage:** A.L.M.T. operates a dedicated CSC that functions as a co-development hub. This facility integrates **processing, measurement, and analysis** on a single floor. Whether you need to simulate grinding conditions using their high-rigidity machining centers or perform analysis with SEM/EDX microscopes to understand tool wear, their CSC allows for a rapid "**Process → Measure → Analyze**" feedback loop to solve your specific engineering headaches.
* **Advanced Heat Spreader Technology:** Beyond standard cutting tools, A.L.M.T. is a leader in **thermal management materials**. Thanks to their expertise in tungsten, molybdenum, and diamond, they manufacture high-thermal-conductivity **heat spreaders** essential for next-gen **electronics** and **EV** components. If you are dealing with heat dissipation issues in compact electronic designs, their composite material solutions offer low thermal expansion and superior heat transfer.
* **Proprietary Green Recycling Technology:** Sustainability is built into their process. They have developed a proprietary "**molten salt dissolution method**" for **recycling tungsten scraps**. This innovative chemical process is safer and more energy-efficient than conventional oxidation roasting treatment. It allows them to recover high-purity tungsten from used carbide tools and sludge, ensuring a stable, conflict-free, and environmentally responsible raw material supply chain for your products.
