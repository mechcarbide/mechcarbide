## Company Profile

### A Legacy of Titans

Hyperion Materials & Technologies stands on the shoulders of industry titans. Its history spans over **seven decades**, rooted in the pioneering work of **General Electric (GE)**, **Diamond Innovations**, and **Sandvik Hard Materials**. Today, as an independent global leader, Hyperion employs over **2,000 experts** across the globe, dedicated to developing advanced hard and super-hard material solutions.

### Global R&D and Innovation

Innovation is in Hyperion's DNA. With a specialized **Carbide Research & Development Center in Barcelona** and materials analysis laboratories in the USA and Germany, the company employs over **130 R&D scientists**. They hold more than **180 active patent families**, proving their commitment to staying ahead of market needs. Their recent expansion includes acquiring specialized precision manufacturers like **GLE Precision** and **Crafts Technology**, further cementing their ability to deliver finished, high-precision components.

### Sustainability & Recycling

Hyperion is deeply committed to closing the loop. Through strategic global partnerships, they offer comprehensive **carbide recycling services**, converting scrap into virgin-quality raw materials. This not only reduces reliance on unstable mining supply chains but also cuts energy consumption by 70% compared to producing new tungsten.

## Capabilities

### The Frontier: Additive Manufacturing (AM)

Hyperion is one of the few companies globally that has mastered **Carbide 3D Printing**.

* **No Compromise:** Unlike traditional sintering, which limits shapes, their AM process delivers complex geometries (such as lattice structures or curved internal channels) with the same wear resistance as conventionally pressed carbide.
* **Rapid Prototyping:** Minimum batch sizes are irrelevant. Customers can test functional carbide prototypes in days, not months.

### World-Class Materials Analysis

Their Worthington, Ohio laboratory is a powerhouse of analytical science, ensuring every batch meets rigorous standards:

* **Microscopy:** Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) for microstructure analysis.
* **Chemical Analysis:** ICP-OES and XRD for precise elemental composition.
* **Physical Testing:** From Vickers hardness to magnetic saturation and porosity analysis.
* **Post-Mortem Analysis:** They don't just sell tools; they analyze why your used tools failed to engineer better solutions for the next generation.

### Specialized Application Competence

Hyperion translates material science into industry-specific dominance:

* **Can Tooling:** Complete solutions for DWI cans, bodymakers, and neckers.
* **Hot Rolling:** Composite rolls and Cast-in-Carbide (CIC™) solutions for steel mills.
* **Rotary Cutting:** High-volume cutters for hygiene and non-woven industries.
