## Editor's Review

If there is one company that defines the history of tungsten carbide, it is CERATIZIT. With roots dating back to 1929, the very dawn of industrial carbide production, CERATIZIT is not just a manufacturer; they are one of the founding fathers of this technology.

### Why this matters to you:

* **Unmatched Grade Stability:** While new factories experiment with formulas, CERATIZIT has nearly a century of data. When you buy their blanks or rods, you are buying **100 years of metallurgical refinement**, ensuring that the rod you buy today performs exactly like the one you buy five years from now.
* **Supply Chain Immunity:** Their strategic 50% stake in Stadler Metalle and advanced in-house recycling technologies mean they are **less vulnerable to global tungsten price fluctuations** or mining shortages than any other competitor.
* **Limitless Capability:** From microscopic 0.2g inserts to massive 700kg high-pressure tools, and from standard rods to 700mm XXL coolant drills, their production range proves they can manufacture virtually **any geometry you can design**.

For tool makers and industrial buyers, partnering with CERATIZIT isn't just a transaction; it's an insurance policy for quality and supply security.

## Company Profile

### A Century of Innovation & Global Dominance

Headquartered in Mamer, Luxembourg, CERATIZIT Group is a global market leader with **over 30 production sites** and **7,000 employees** worldwide. The company traces its origins back to 1929, when Dr. Paul Schwarzkopf pioneered the series production of tungsten carbide. Since the 2002 merger of CERAMETAL and Plansee Tizit, the group has aggressively expanded through strategic acquisitions (such as Günther Wirth, Klenk, and Best Carbide), cementing its position as a top-tier player in every major industrial market from Europe to Asia and the Americas.

### Beyond Manufacturing: The Tooling Academy

Unlike competitors who simply ship products, CERATIZIT invests heavily in customer success. They have established multiple **"CERATIZIT Innovation Centers" (formerly Tooling Academies)** in Austria, China, and beyond. These are not just showrooms but full-scale testing and training facilities where customers can validate machining processes using state-of-the-art analytical technology.

### Sustainability & Responsibility

CERATIZIT is leading the industry's green transition. With **ISO 50001 certification** and the proprietary **"upGRADE" product family**, they produce premium carbide grades using >99% secondary raw materials, proving that high performance and low carbon footprint can coexist.

## Capabilities

### Production & Technology

**Mastery of the Extremes**

CERATIZIT's production capabilities cover the entire spectrum of physical possibilities in carbide manufacturing:

* **Extreme Dimensions:** Capable of producing everything from lightweight inserts (0.2g) to massive high-pressure anvils (**700 kg**) and XXL rods (**700 mm length**).
* **Complex Extrusion:** Decades of expertise allow them to manufacture **50° spiraled carbide rods** with coolant holes—a critical requirement for aerospace drilling (CFRP/Titanium) that few competitors can achieve.
* **Hardest Coatings:** Their patented CVD-TiB2 coating reaches **4,500 Vickers** **hardness**, second only to diamond, enabling the machining of the toughest superalloys.
* **Gradient Structure:** To overcome the thermal expansion mismatch between carbide and steel, CERATIZIT employs a proprietary **Gradient Structure**. This technology ensures the cutting tip remains extremely hard while the connection zone is engineered to be tough, **preventing stress cracks** and ensuring a stable weld with steel shanks.

**Logistics & Inventory Power**

* **Speed:** Their state-of-the-art picking system in Kempten, Germany, packs orders in just **3 minutes**, ensuring rapid global dispatch.
* **Availability:** With over **75,000 items** in stock and a 99% delivery capacity, they serve as a massive virtual warehouse for their partners.

**The Ultimate Recycling Loop (Zinc & Chemical)**

CERATIZIT doesn't just recycle; they master the science of it. They employ two distinct methods:

* **Zinc Process:** An eco-friendly thermal process that reclaims tungsten carbide without changing its original grain size (ideal for high-quality regrinding).
* **Chemical Process:** Dissolving scrap to atomic constituents to create virgin-quality raw materials.

This dual approach allows them to offer **"upGRADE" grades**—carbides made from 99% recycled material with zero compromise in performance.
