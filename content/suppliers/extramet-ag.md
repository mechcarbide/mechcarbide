## 📌Why Choose EXTRAMET AG?

**Best For:** High-tech manufacturers (Aerospace, Medical, Watchmaking) and Tool Makers requiring application-specific grades and complex preform geometries.

* **Application-Driven Solution Center:** EXTRAMET goes beyond manufacturing by operating a dedicated **Application Center** (commissioned in 2024). Instead of just supplying material, they perform **in-house milling and drilling tests** to validate performance. For the buyer, this means access to independent **material analysis** and root-cause investigation for tool breakage, ensuring the carbide grade selected is scientifically proven to work for your specific machining environment before you commit to volume production.
* **Specialized Grades for Exotic Materials:** They have developed **proprietary grades** specifically for difficult-to-machine composites found in Aerospace and Medical sectors. For instance, their **EMT100 grade** (used in diamond-coated or uncoated tools) is engineered to machine Ti/CFRP stacks and Zirconium Oxide. This technology solves the issue of rapid tool wear in mixed-material drilling, proven to increase tool service life by up to 140% in aircraft fuselage manufacturing.
* **Advanced Preforming for Cost Efficiency:** EXTRAMET utilizes advanced **CNC machining centers** to produce **Replaceable Head Blanks** and complex preforms with tight tolerances. By delivering **"near-net" shapes**, including preformed flutes, cooling channels, and threaded connections, they significantly reduce the grinding time and wheel wear for tool manufacturers. This capability allows customers to produce modular milling systems more economically by reducing raw material waste and cycle times.
* **360° Sustainability & Circular Economy:** For environmentally conscious buyers, EXTRAMET offers a complete **360-degree recycling service**. They operate a closed-loop European cycle, recycling not just **solid scrap** but also **grinding sludge** through long-term partnerships. This ensures a sustainable supply chain and helps customers meet their own ecological responsibility goals while recovering value from used tools (drills, cutters) and production waste.
