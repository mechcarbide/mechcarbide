Founded in 1956 by Minnesota farmer Dick Loftness, the company began when he built a V-type snow blower in his farm shop. As demand grew, Marv Nelson, a local farmer, joined as a distributor in 1970 and later bought the business in 1979, guiding it into a new era of growth and innovation. Under the Nelson family's leadership, Loftness expanded from snow blowers to **vegetation management equipment and agricultural equipment.** 

In 2020, the company became **employee-owned through an ESOP program**, ensuring that every team member shares in its legacy of innovation, quality, and customer success. Today, Loftness remains dedicated to producing equipment that performs reliably in the toughest conditions.
