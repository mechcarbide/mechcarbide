## Editor's Review

Sandvik Coromant doesn't just follow industry trends; they set them. As the company that essentially popularized the indexable insert with the T-Max in 1957 and standardized the tooling interface with Coromant Capto® in 1990, their DNA is written into almost every modern CNC machine.

### Why they are the undisputed leader:

* **Innovation at Scale:** Launching 2,500+ new products every year isn't just a statistic; it means that no matter how complex your new aerospace or EV component is, Sandvik likely developed a specific tool for it last week.
* **PrimeTurning™ Revolution:** Their recent invention of PrimeTurning™ (turning in all directions) is a game-changer, potentially doubling productivity for turning operations. This is the kind of efficiency leap that only a giant like Sandvik can deliver.
* **Manufacturing Wellness:** They look beyond the cutting edge. Their robust recycling buy-back program and reconditioning services help factories reduce CO2 emissions and recover costs, aligning your production with global sustainability goals.
