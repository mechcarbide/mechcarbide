## 📌Why Choose Hydro Carbide?

**Best For:** Toolmakers needing complex "near-net" shapes to reduce grinding time, and industries (Energy/Defense) requiring high-reliability wear parts.

* **Near-Net Shape Preforms:** Hydro Carbide excels at reducing your production costs before the material even reaches your facility. By machining carbide in its "green" (soft) state to your specific profiles, including tapers, steps, and threads, they deliver **pre-formed blanks** that require minimal stock removal. This significantly cuts down your diamond wheel wear and EDM machine time.
* **Proprietary Grades & "Stress-Free" EDM Blocks:** For **die makers**, material stability is non-negotiable. Hydro Carbide utilizes a unique manufacturing system backed by university research to produce **Stress-Free EDM blocks**. These blocks are engineered to remain defect-free during the rigorous wire EDM process, preventing costly cracking or material failure. Additionally, they offer specialized grades like **Ramet1®** (10% sub-micron) for rotary tooling and **HC-292**, specifically formulated as a superior substrate for diamond coating applications.
* **Heavy Industry & Large Part Capability:** Hydro Carbide has the pressing and sintering capacity to handle massive industrial components. They manufacture **rings and rolls** up to **12 inches in diameter** and **20 inches long** with **100% density**. Whether it's high-pressure pump plungers for the oil industry or heavy-duty mining compacts with high cobalt content (10-19%), they build parts designed to survive extreme impact and abrasion.
* **Technical Metallurgy & US-Based Agility:** Hydro Carbide isn't just a shop; it's a metallurgical partner with a history of supplying the **US Department of Defense**. Their in-house engineering team provides expert failure analysis and grade selection, helping you formulate the best composition for your specific application. With a focus on service, they offer competitive lead times for special orders (typically **2-3 weeks**) and maintain stock of standard rods in the USA for immediate delivery.
