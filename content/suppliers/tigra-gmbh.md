## 📌Editor's Insight

**Best For:** Industrial tool makers and wholesalers requiring absolute dimensional consistency and specialized material grades for harsh environments.

**The Bottom Line:** TIGRA is the "gold standard" for buyers who cannot afford batch-to-batch variations. They are particularly valuable for woodworking clients dealing with acidic woods, as their specialized grades significantly outlast standard market carbide. It is a premium choice for high-precision, automated production lines.

**Metalworking:** Rods, Bars, Milling Blanks, Inserts for PCD/PcBN.

**Specialties:** TIGRALLOY (Compound), TIGRAmet (Heavy Metal), PCD & PcBN Blanks.

## ✨Core Competencies

### A. Technical Edge (Process & Materials)

* **Proprietary Machinery:** Unlike competitors using standard presses, TIGRA designs and builds its own production and measuring equipment in-house. This allows for tighter tolerances and unique geometries that off-the-shelf machines cannot produce.
* **Advanced Metallurgy:** They do not buy ready-mixed powder. By operating massive spray-drying towers and controlling the mix from the raw material stage, they create unique binders (e.g., Nickel/Chrome) that solve specific corrosion and wear problems.

### B. Supply Chain & Reliability

* **Logistics Powerhouse:** With a dedicated 1,300 m² logistics center and over 10,000 m² of facilities, TIGRA acts as a massive "buffer warehouse" for its clients, ensuring rapid shipment even for large orders.
* **Global Stability:** As a German "Hidden Champion" with 80%+ export share and subsidiaries in the USA, China, and Brazil, they offer the local support of a domestic supplier backed by German engineering.
