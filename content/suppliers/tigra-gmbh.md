## Editor's Review

While many suppliers claim 'quality,' TIGRA validates it through a unique technical advantage: **Self-Constructed Machinery**. Unlike factories that rely on standard market equipment, TIGRA builds and programs its own measuring and production units in-house. For buyers, this translates to a level of dimensional precision and flexibility that is hard to replicate.

From a material perspective, TIGRA goes beyond standard grades. Their expertise in **Corrosion-Resistant Binders** (replacing Cobalt with Nickel/Chrome) is a game-changer for woodworking clients dealing with acidic woods or moisture, significantly extending tool life where standard carbide fails.

Finally, their massive investment in a dedicated **logistics building** proves they are not just a manufacturer, but a reliable supply chain partner. With over 10,000 m² of facilities and an 80% export share, TIGRA is the ideal choice for buyers who cannot afford production stoppages due to delayed shipments.

## Company Profile

### History & Establishment

Founded in 1983 by Dr. Harald Feld and Helge Motzer, TIGRA GmbH has evolved from a specialized grinding facility into a global powerhouse in tungsten carbide manufacturing. As one of the industry's pioneers, TIGRA was among the first to mass-produce profile blanks specifically for woodworking. Over four decades, they have expanded from a local German manufacturer to a "Hidden Champion" with an export share exceeding 80%, serving customers in over 75 countries.

### Manufacturing Capacity & Expansion

Headquartered in Oberndorf am Lech, Germany, TIGRA operates a massive, continually expanding production area. The facility has undergone four major construction phases (1995, 2004, 2012, and 2016) to meet growing global demand. Notably, the addition of a dedicated 1,300 m² logistics building in 2012 and a large-scale production hall in 2016 demonstrates their capacity to handle high-volume orders with reliable lead times. Today, the site employs around 240 professionals and utilizes proprietary, self-constructed machinery to ensure "Made in Germany" precision.

### Global Presence

To support its vast international client base, TIGRA has established a strong local presence in key markets. Beyond its German headquarters, the company operates subsidiaries in:

* USA: Hickory, NC (Established 2000, expanded 2011)
* Brazil: Curitiba (Established 2005)
* China: Guangzhou & Beijing (Established 2007/2011)

This global network ensures that international tool makers and distributors receive localized technical support and faster product delivery.

## Capabilities

### Production

**Full Vertical Integration: From Powder to Finished Product**

Unlike assemblers who purchase ready-to-press powder, TIGRA controls the entire manufacturing value chain in-house. This ensures absolute quality control over the metallurgical structure and dimensional precision.

**Advanced Powder Metallurgy:**

TIGRA produces its own RTP (Ready-to-Press) granulates using massive 6-8 meter high spray drying towers. This guarantees spherical powder shape for optimal density.

* Binder Versatility: Beyond standard Cobalt binders, TIGRA specializes in Corrosion-Resistant Grades (Nickel/Chrome binders) and complex binders (Iron/Molybdenum) for challenging woodworking environments.

**Versatile Forming Technologies:**

To achieve precise "Near-Net Shapes," TIGRA employs a wide range of forming methods, including:

* Pressing: Uniaxial & Isostatic pressing.
* Shaping: Extrusion & Injection Molding (MIM) for complex geometries.
* Green Machining: Cutting, drilling, and turning carbides in the "soft stage" allows for highly customized preforms before sintering.

**Sintering & Finishing:**

Sintering is performed at approximately 1400°C using Pressure Sintering (Sinter-HIP) technology to eliminate porosity. Final products undergo high-precision flat and edge grinding to meet strict tolerances.

**Capacity:**

This integrated process allows TIGRA to manufacture hundreds of millions of parts annually with uniform mechanical values.

### Grades
