  Sanalloy Industry Co., Ltd., headquartered in Hyogo, Japan, is a specialized
  manufacturer of high-performance cemented carbides. Originating as the 'Sanyo
  Alloy Research Institute' in 1963, the company retains a strong R&D focus,
  solving complex manufacturing issues with proprietary materials like the
  'P-Series' (Low Friction Alloy) for anti-sticking and 'MBN Alloy' for
  corrosion resistance. Sanalloy utilizes standard HIP (Hot Isostatic Pressing)
  technology for defect-free production. With a strong Asian network (Thailand,
  Malaysia, China) and a newly opened Second Plant in 2024, Sanalloy serves the
  EV, automotive, and precision electronics industries.

## 📌 Why Choose Sanalloy?

Best For: EV & Automotive Component Suppliers, Precision Electronic Mold Makers, and Deep Drawing Houses struggling with tool adhesion (galling) or chemical corrosion.

The Technical Advantage (Hard Power)

PRD12N Grade: This is Sanalloy's new grade specifically designed for motor core molds, essential for the production of electric vehicle (EV) components. It offers superior seizure resistance, wear resistance, and corrosion resistance, making it highly effective for punching electromagnetic steel sheets and significantly extending die life.

Dual-Protection Metallurgy (MBN Alloy): Typically, carbide is either hard or corrosion-resistant, rarely both. Sanalloy developed the MBN Alloy to solve this trade-off. It maintains high hardness for wear resistance while withstanding chemical degradation, making it the perfect solution for molds exposed to corrosive resins or harsh lubricants that would eat away at standard grades.

The Operational Advantage (Soft Power)

Expanding Capacity & Stability: While many manufacturers are consolidating, Sanalloy is aggressively growing. The opening of their Second Plant in 2024 significantly boosted production capacity. For global buyers, this signals robust financial health and guarantees shorter, more reliable lead times for both prototype and mass-production orders.

Research-Driven Problem Solving: Originating as a "Research Institute" rather than a mass-production factory, their core DNA is metallurgical problem solving. They don't just sell standard catalogs; they actively act as technical consultants to customize alloy compositions for clients facing specific failure modes.
