## Quick Facts

**Headquarters:** Germany

**Established:** 1954

**Business Type:** Manufacturer

**Employee:** >1,200 (Worldwide)

## 📌 Editor's Insight

**Best For:** Furniture manufacturers and interior fitters working with difficult composite materials, high-gloss panels, or exotic veneers that are prone to chipping.

**The Bottom Line:** LEUCO is the ultimate problem-solver for "**finish quality**" straight off the machine. Their patented geometry changes the physics of cutting into "**peeling**," guaranteeing chip-free edges on mixed materials and effectively eliminating the need for downstream sanding, which significantly reduces production costs.

## 📦 Products

**Circular Saw Blades:** Panel Sizing, Thin-Kerf, Gang-Rip, and "No-Noise" blades.

**CNC & Shank Tools:** High-performance Router Bits, Jointing/Rabbeting Cutters.

**Hoggers:** PowerTec, UniTec, and CompactTec systems for edge banding lines.

**Boring & Drilling:** High-precision Twist Drills, Through-Hole Bits, Dowel Bits.

**Precision Systems:** p-System tools (Peeling functionality), Modula systems.

**Clamping & Accessories:** Hydraulic clamping, HSK arbors, Turnover Knives.

## ✨ Core Competencies

### A. Technical Edge (The "p-System" & Aerodynamics)

* **The "Peeling" Revolution (p-System):** Unlike standard cutters that "chop" wood fibers, LEUCO's patented **p-System** features an extreme shear angle (≥55°). This acts like a razor, "peeling" the material rather than cutting it, which solves the industry-wide problem of edge chipping on sensitive surfaces (linoleum, veneers, plywood).
* **Noise & Dust Control (LowNoise):** LEUCO treats the tool as an aerodynamic object. Their **airFace** surface design channels airflow to reduce noise by up to **3 dB**, while the **AirStream** system captures up to **99% of dust**, significantly improving workshop safety and machine cleanliness.

### B. Business Model & Digitalization

* **Direct Manufacturer Access:** Unlike many competitors who rely solely on distributors, LEUCO maintains a robust **Direct Sales Strategy**. This ensures customers receive technical advice straight from the engineers who designed the tools, without middleman markups or communication delays.
* **Smart Lifecycle Management:** They offer a global **resharpening** network that restores tools to original factory geometries. Furthermore, the LEUCO **Tool Info App** allows operators to scan laser-etched codes on the tool to instantly access sharpening history and optimal RPM/feed rate data.

## 🏆 Certificates
