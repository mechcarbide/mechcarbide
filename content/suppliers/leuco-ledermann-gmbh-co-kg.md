## Editor's Review

In a crowded market of standard cutters, LEUCO stands out as a true innovator. While others were tweaking blade angles by a few degrees, LEUCO revolutionized the physics of woodworking with their patented **p-System**. By increasing the shear angle to ≥55°, they transformed the process from 'cutting' to '**peeling**', solving the age-old problem of chipping on mixed materials and exotic veneers.

### Why LEUCO deserves your attention:

* **Unrivaled Finish Quality:** If you are processing high-gloss panels, plywood, or fibrous exotic woods, the p-System is arguably the best solution on the market. It delivers a 'finish-cut' quality straight off the machine, eliminating the need for sanding.
* **Silence in the Factory:** Their **airFace** and **AirStream** designs are not just marketing gimmicks; they fundamentally change how air flows around the tool, significantly reducing noise (up to -3dB) and capturing up to 99% of dust.
* **Direct Manufacturer Access:** Unlike brands that hide behind distributors, LEUCO’s **direct sales model** ensures you get technical advice straight from the source, without middleman markups or communication delays.

## Company Profile

### 70 Years of Trend-Setting Innovation

Founded in 1954 by Willi Ledermann and Josef Störzer in Horb am Neckar, Germany, LEUCO has grown from a local workshop into one of the world's largest suppliers of carbide and diamond-tipped machine tools. Today, the company employs over **1,200 people** across five continents, with subsidiaries in key markets like the USA, China, and Switzerland.

### Global Reach, German Quality

With an export share of approx. 70%, LEUCO is a truly global player. However, they maintain strict quality control rooted in German engineering excellence, as evidenced by their **DIN EN ISO 9001** and **ISO 50001** certifications. Their commitment to innovation has been recognized repeatedly, winning prestigious awards such as the **German Innovation Award** (2018, 2019) and the **Schweighofer Innovation Prize** for their groundbreaking p-System.

### Direct Connection

Uniquely, LEUCO prioritizes a **direct sales strategy**, maintaining **20 subsidiaries** and **93 sales partners** worldwide to ensure that sawmills, furniture factories, and interior fitters receive tailored advice and immediate service support.

## Capabilities

### The p-System Revolution (Peeling vs. Cutting)

LEUCO's flagship technology features an extreme shear angle of **≥55° to 90°**.

* **How it works:** Instead of chopping the wood fibers, the tool slices them like a razor knife.
* **The Benefit:** This "peeling" action allows for **chip-free jointing** even on difficult materials like fabric-coated panels, linoleum, and cross-grain veneers. It also extends tool life significantly compared to standard diamond tools.

### Noise & Dust Control (LowNoise)

LEUCO engineering focuses heavily on the operator's environment:

* **airFace Design:** An aerodynamic surface structure on the tool body that channels airflow, reducing noise by up to **3 dB(A)**.
* **AirStream-System:** A patented chip capture technology that optimizes the flow of dust into the extraction hood, keeping machines cleaner and air safer.

### Lifecycle Management

* **Resharpening Network:** A global "Tool Management" service ensures tools are re-ground to original factory specs. They even offer **Color Coding** services to help factories visualize and organize their tool inventory.
* **Digital Integration:** The **LEUCO Tool Info App** allows operators to scan serialized tools to access history, remaining sharpening cycles, and optimal machining parameters instantly.
