### Construction

Cutting tools and bits for milling, trenching, tunneling, and rock cutting applications.

### Agriculture

Wear parts with or without carbide protection for soil cultivation.

## Manufacturing and Quality Highlights

### Fully Controlled Production Process

Each step, from tungsten carbide powder formulation, pressing, and sintering to forging, machining, and finishing, is strictly monitored and tested for strength and consistency.

### KingGrit Technology (Carbide Grit Hardfacing)

A proprietary process where tungsten carbide granules are embedded into the base material using computer-controlled MIG welding. This creates a rough, hardfaced surface combining high wear resistance and excellent impact strength, ideal for demanding conditions.

### Testing & Surface Treatment

Every part undergoes mechanical and performance testing, followed by shot-blasting to enhance surface protection and appearance.
