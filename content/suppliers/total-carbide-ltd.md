## Quick Facts

**Headquarters:** United Kingdom

**Established:** 1937

**Business Type:** Manufacturer

**Ideal For:** Oil & Gas OEMs, Pump & Seal Manufacturers, Custom Wear Part Buyers

## Editor's Review

Total Carbide holds a unique position as the **UK's largest independent carbide manufacturer**. Free from the rigid catalogs of global conglomerates, they offer a level of bespoke engineering flexibility that is hard to find elsewhere.

### Why they are a top-tier choice:

* **The Intraform™ Breakthrough:** Their proprietary Intraform™ process is a game-changer for **flow control** industries. It allows for the creation of **complex internal geometries** in carbide **valves and nozzles** that last **10x longer** than cast steel, withstanding pressures up to **760 bar**.
* **Total Control:** From their purpose-built powder preparation facility (opened in 1997) to final HIP sintering, they control every grain of powder. This **vertical integration** is crucial for **maintaining the consistency** required by Oil & Gas and Aerospace clients.
* **Design-Led Manufacturing:** Unlike "print-to-part" shops, Total Carbide's engineering team often steps in at the concept stage, **optimizing customer designs** to save costs and improve performance before a single gram of powder is pressed.

## Product Range

* Tungsten Carbide Wear Parts (oil & gas, aerospace)
* Tungsten Carbide Flow Control Components
* Tungsten Carbide Special Inserts (metal cutting)
* Tungsten Carbide Circular Cutting Knives and Discs (paper, tobacco, rubber, fibre, and foil)
* Tungsten Carbide Die Parts and Blanks
* Tungsten Carbide Measurement and Inspection Components

## Company Profile

### A Legacy of British Engineering

Total Carbide is the modern evolution of two historic British pioneers: **Hoybide** (est. 1950s) and **Teco** (est. 1930s). Merged in 2000 and rebranded in 2009, the company is now a key part of **Versarien plc**, an advanced materials group listed on the AIM market.

### State-of-the-Art Facility

Operating from a custom-built facility at Westcott Venture Park (relocated in 2016), Total Carbide combines **70 years** of heritage with cutting-edge technology. As the UK's leading independent manufacturer, they serve a global client base with a focus on **Oil & Gas**, **Aerospace**, and Industrial Wear applications. Their affiliation with Versarien plc places them at the forefront of material innovation, constantly exploring new frontiers in tungsten carbide performance.

## Capabilities

### Proprietary Technology: Intraform™

* **Complex Geometries:** This unique process enables the production of carbide components with intricate internal forms (e.g., choke valves) that are impossible to machine using conventional methods.
* **Extreme Durability:** Independently tested to withstand 760 bar pressure for 25,000 cycles, proving its reliability for subsea and high-pressure applications.

### Manufacturing Muscle

* **Large Format Pressing:** Capable of producing rings and components up to **420mm** in diameter, catering to large-scale industrial **pump and seal** requirements.
* **HIP Sintering:** All products undergo Hot Isostatic Pressing to eliminate porosity, ensuring maximum density and strength.
* **Precision Finishing:** A comprehensive finishing department offering CNC cylindrical grinding, EDM wire/die-sinking, and lapping to 2 light-bands flatness.

### Powder & Design

* **Custom Blends:** With an in-house powder preparation plant, they create application-specific grades rather than relying on standard market powders.
* **Reverse Engineering:** Capable of scanning worn steel components and re-engineering them in tungsten carbide for vastly extended service life.
