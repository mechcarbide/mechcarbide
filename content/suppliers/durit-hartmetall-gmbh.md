## 📌Why Choose Durit Hartmetall?

**Best For:** Industrial Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) in high-wear sectors like Oil & Gas, Chemical, and Recycling requiring "Substrate + Coating" solutions.

* **100% Coating Competency & Hybrid Solutions:** Durit stands out by integrating carbide manufacturing with a complete range of surface technologies. They provide **coating solutions** including **Laser Cladding, HVOF, APS, PVD, and CVD**. This capability allows them to engineer a dual-layer defense, optimizing the carbide substrate for toughness while tailoring the surface for specific corrosion, erosion, or friction challenges.
* **Extensive Material Portfolio (60+ Grades):** With **over 60 carbide grades**, Durit offers exceptional flexibility for specific industrial applications. Whether the requirement is for corrosion-resistant grades with Nickel/Chrome binders for the food industry or high-fracture toughness grades for recycling crushers, they can precisely match the material composition to the operating environment.
* **Integrated Service Center & Regrinding:** Durit reduces the total cost of ownership through its **Service Center**. By combining **logistics** with an **in-house regrinding and repair service**, they can refurbish worn tools and upgrade wear parts to "better-than-new" condition using their coating technologies. This extends the lifecycle of expensive tooling and minimizes production downtime.
* **Knowledge Transfer & Engineering Support:** They operate as a technical partner rather than just a vendor. Through their **CAD-supported design department**, they co-develop unique geometries to solve specific wear problems. Furthermore, they offer **technical workshops** to train your engineers and machine operators on carbide properties, helping your team optimize workflows and prevent tool failure before it happens.
