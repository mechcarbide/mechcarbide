## Company Profile

### From Local Workshop to Global Market Leader

Founded in 1876 by Albert Leitz in Oberkochen, Germany, the company has evolved into the world's leading manufacturer of tools for machining wood and advanced materials. Today, Leitz is part of the **Brucklacher Group**, creating a powerful synergy with sister companies **Boehlerit** (carbide experts) and **Bilz** (clamping specialists). This vertical integration gives Leitz unique access to proprietary carbide grades and clamping technologies that competitors cannot access.

### Global Scale & Proximity

With **9 production plants**, **38 distribution centers**, and over **4,000 employees** globally, Leitz follows a philosophy of "production reliability through proximity." Whether you are in Europe, Asia, or the Americas, a Leitz expert is never far away. Their unrivaled commitment to R&D is evidenced by over **1,000 patents** and utility models, consistently driving the industry forward with smarter, more sustainable solutions.

## Capabilities

### Revolutionary Cutting Technologies

* **Marathon Coating:** A proprietary coating that extends tool life by up to **5 times**, especially effective in wet and acidic woods (a common pain point in window manufacturing).
* **WhisperCut:** The industry benchmark for noise reduction. By using lightweight bodies and optimized geometries, these tools reduce noise by up to **5 dB(A)**—a massive improvement for worker safety.
* **RipTec Cutting:** A patented ribbed cutting profile that increases the glue surface area for window joints, creating stronger, weather-resistant connections.

### Digital & Intelligent Tooling

* **Tools with "Memory":** Leitz was the first to embed **electronic chips** in tools, enabling seamless tracking of tool life, sharpening cycles, and machining parameters within a CNC environment.
* **LeitzXPert App:** A digital knowledge base that puts 140 years of machining data into the operator's pocket, offering instant cutting data calculations and tool identification.

### Service & Lifecycle Management

* **Resharpening Network:** With over **120 service locations** globally, Leitz picks up your dull tools and returns them sharpened to original factory specifications.
* **Tool Recycling:** A sustainable loop where Leitz collects used carbide scrap (drills, inserts) and credits the customer, ensuring raw materials are responsibly recycled.
