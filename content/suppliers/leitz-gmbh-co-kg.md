This vertical integration allows them to develop proprietary carbide grades and clamping solutions that standalone toolmakers cannot access.

* **Structural Solutions:** Pioneers of the **RipTec** jointing system, which optimizes wood surface structure for stronger, weather-resistant glue joints in **window manufacturing**.

### B. Service Ecosystem & Digitalization

* **Global Resharpening Network:** With over **100 service centers** worldwide, Leitz offers a unique "pick-up and return" service. Tools are reground to original factory geometries, ensuring consistent performance over the tool's entire lifespan.
* **Digital Intelligence:** A leader in **Tool Management 4.0**. Their tools feature embedded microchips ("Tools with Memory") and QR codes tailored for the **LeitzXPert App**, allowing CNC machines to automatically read data and track remaining tool life.
* **Outsourcing Solutions:** The **CompleteCare** program allows large factories to fully outsource tool logistics, stock management, and sharpening to Leitz, turning fixed tool costs into variable usage costs.
