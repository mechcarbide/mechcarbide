Hi there, and welcome to **mechcarbide.com**. I'm **Alice Jian**, and this blog is where I share what I've learned (and continue to learn) about **carbide wear parts and tools** used in industries like **forestry**, **construction**, **oil & gas**, and more.

## Why I Started This Blog

For five years, I worked as an internet marketing specialist at a foreign trade company that sold tungsten carbide tools and wear parts overseas. To be honest, I wasn't interested in any of it at first. I didn't even know what tungsten carbide was! But over time, as I got more familiar with the materials, products, and their real-world applications, I began to find it all... fascinating. Tough, precise, and built for extreme conditions, these tools have stories behind them.

That curiosity is what inspired me to start this blog. Not to sell anything, but simply to **share knowledge**, in a way that's clear, helpful, and accessible, whether you're new to the field or already working in it.

## Why Not Just Let Companies Do It?

That was a question I asked myself, too. Most websites about carbide tools are run by B2B or B2C companies. Their focus is on marketing their products, not on helping people truly understand the materials, processes, and innovations behind them. This blog is different. It's not about sales. It's about **curiosity, learning, and sharing**, from one person to another.
