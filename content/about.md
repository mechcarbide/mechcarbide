Hi there, and welcome to **mechcarbide.com**. I'm **Alex Carter**, and this blog is where I share what I've learned (and continue to learn) about **carbide tools and wear parts** used in industries like **forestry**, **construction**, **woodworking**, **metalworking**, and more.

## Why I Started This Website

For five years, I worked as an internet marketing specialist at a foreign trade company that sold tungsten carbide tools and wear parts overseas. To be honest, I wasn't interested in any of it at first. I didn't even know what tungsten carbide was! But over time, as I got more familiar with the materials, products, and their real-world applications, I began to find it all... fascinating. Tough, precise, and built for extreme conditions, these tools have stories behind them.

That curiosity is what inspired me to start this blog. Not to sell anything, but simply to **share knowledge and provide information**, in a way that's clear, helpful, and accessible, whether you're new to the field or already working in it.

## What You'll Find Here

From woodworking tools like **router bits**, **circular saw blades** and **planer blades**, to industrial wear parts such as **road milling teeth**, **PDC cutters**, and **carbide hardfacing**, this blog explains the materials, applications, and working principles of these products.

In addition to informative articles, MechCarbide provides **a curated list of suppliers for carbide tools and industrial wear parts**. Whether you're looking for a supplier for woodworking tools, metalworking tools, or heavy equipment wear parts, the supplier list helps you quickly find companies and contact information you can trust.
