**Welcome to mechcarbide.com!**

Hi, I'm Shijie (Alice) Jian, the person behind this site.

If you're looking for a place to start your sourcing journey for tungsten carbide tools and wear parts, without the noise of giant B2B platforms, you've landed in the right spot.

### A Little Background

For nearly five years, I worked as an internet marketing specialist at a foreign trade company that manufactured and supplied tungsten carbide tools and wear parts to customers around the world. To be honest? I didn't know a thing about tungsten carbide when I started. I barely even knew what it *was*. But over time, writing about it, talking to engineers, learning how these tiny pieces of metal actually behave inside a road milling machine or a woodworking router, I got hooked. There's something oddly fascinating about materials built to handle extreme conditions.

### What This Site Is (and Isn't)

This website is my way of organizing what I've learned, and sharing it in a way that's actually useful.

**What it *is*:** A supplier directory. Organized by industry (construction, woodworking, metalworking, mining, etc.) and by region. I personally summarize each supplier's features based on what I know, so you're not just staring at a list of names, you're getting a little context.

**What it *isn't*:** A platform with paid placements, biased rankings, or sponsored listings. I'm trying to keep this space as neutral as possible. If a supplier is listed here, it's because they make decent stuff, not because they paid to be seen.

### How I Can Help

If you're sourcing carbide products and need a hand, or if you've got a writing project related to this industry, here's what I can do, all via email.

**1. Sourcing Assistance (Free Introduction)**
If you're looking for a specific type of product, say, router bits or road milling teeth, and you'd like a recommendation for reliable Chinese suppliers, **send me an email with your requirements.** I know the landscape here, and I'm happy to point you in the right direction. No fees, no strings attached.

**2. Technical Writing, Translation & Proofreading**
My background is in writing and editing. If you need help with:
- Writing or polishing technical articles about carbide applications
- Translating or proofreading product brochures, websites, or technical documents (Chinese to English, or just cleaning up English that doesn't quite flow)

...I'm your person. This is the "pen for hire" side of what I do, and honestly, it's the kind of work I enjoy most.

### Get in Touch

This site is still growing. I add new suppliers, write new posts, and slowly shape it into something more useful. If you have feedback, a question, a supplier to suggest, or a project you think I might be able to help with, **I'd genuinely love to hear from you.**
